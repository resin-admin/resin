  All sizing/spacing throughout the app is based on a [modular scale](http://modularscale.com/) with a base of 16. Use the `size(value)` function to calculate values as needed. For example `size(3)` will return `36px`.

  - size(1) | 16px
  - size(2) | 24px
  - size(3) | 36px
  - size(4) | 54px
  - size(5) | 81px

  - size(7) | 182.25px
  - size(8) | 237.375px
